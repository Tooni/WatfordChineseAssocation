            The Association started over 30 years ago. Watford Borough Council
            realised that the welfare of the local community was somewhat
            overlooked. It asked Mrs Hutchinson to set up an association to
            provide a socialising platform for the Chinese community. With a
            group of volunteers including Mrs Kim Wong the Watford Chinese
            Association was established in 1996. Initially they met every
            Tuesday, when the takeaways were closed for business, at the
            Hollywell Community Centre. Now we have over 300 families as
            members. Most live in West Hertfordshire but some come from as far
            as south of the Thames, and some are of different nationalities.

            The School formed a Dancing Group. It was invited to perform at the
            Watford Carnival, the World Economic Forum dinner, the Queen's
            Jubilee in Buckingham Palace and other venues. It won the first
            prize at the UK Chinese School Association competition.

            Over the years, the Association has provided a bridge for
            multi-cultural exchange. Together with other ethnic groups, it
            helped to set up Watford Celebration, a festival of culture and
            beliefs.

            As a result of increasing elderly membership, the Watford
            Association Centre for the Older People was created in 2013. Its
            principal mission is to provide a centre for social activities for
            the Chinese elderly community, and others, from the surrounding
            areas who are interested in Chinese culture and tradition.

            The Association organise lunches and dinners for the major festivals
            of the year, such as Chinese New Year, The Dragon Boat Festival, The
            Mid-Autumn Festival and Christmas. On average, we have 80 to 100
            people at these events. They are sponsored by Chinese supermarkets,
            such as See Woo and Wing Yip. We are most thankful for their
            sponsorship.

            We have also organised the Chinese New Year Culture Show at the

            dances, songs, music, magic, acrobats, marshal arts and Bian Lian
