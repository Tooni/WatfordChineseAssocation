      Anita Chan, chair of the Watford Chinese Association said: "This
      Snake year's Chinese Culture Show was a success. The energy in the
      auditorium was electric, and it is clear that an event like this
      brought our community closer together. The night party showcased a
      variety of traditional art which had touched innumerable people
      with its profound cultural heritage performances. It is wonderful
      that the Spring Festival brought people together to appreciate
      Chinese cultural traditions, regardless of their backgrounds."
